Youtube data analysis project: 

I collected the data from youtuve v3 API and stored in .csv then there comes the descriptive statistics. Using matplotlib and seaborn plotted like, view, comment counts. The correlation matrix for like, view, comment counts is drawn. Fetched category names and category mapping done. Then scatter plots and bar charts are visualized for view, like and comment counts wrt duration. The scatter plot shows tags vs view counts and publishes hour vs view count. At last, conclusion and insights are inferenced.
